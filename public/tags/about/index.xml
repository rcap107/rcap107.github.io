      <description>Hi! My name is Riccardo Cappuzzo, and I&amp;rsquo;m the author of this blog. I hold a PhD in Computer Science, which I&amp;rsquo;ve obtained from Sorbonne University after working for three and a half years at EURECOM, in Sophia Antipolis. I&amp;rsquo;ve been living in the south of France for almost six years now, starting as a student at EURECOM during my Master Degree.
I got my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s degree in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino in Turin, then I continued on with a Master degree in Communications and Computer Networks Engineering from the same university.</description>
