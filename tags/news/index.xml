      <description>We submitted a revised version of our benchmarking paper to VLDB 2024, with the title &amp;ldquo;Retrieve, Merge, Predict: Augmenting Tables with Data Lakes&amp;rdquo;.
The preprint can be found on Arxiv, while the code has its own website, and is available on Github.
We also release YADL, the semi-synthetic benchmarking data lake that we used to run our experiments. The repository is also available on Github.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, hasn&amp;rsquo;t it? According the newly added archives page, the latest post in this blog goes back all the way to July 2022&amp;hellip; Well, it does not seem like I kept my (very tentative) promise of posting frequently.
No matter! Something did happen a few months ago (last October), and I have been quite busy because of it. I have moved to Paris! For the next two years (starting last October), I have been/will be working as a Postdoctoral Researcher for Inria Saclay in the SODA Team and at Dataiku in their research department.</description>
