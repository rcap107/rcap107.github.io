      <description>In this post, I will describe the code I have developed to run the thermometer, log the data and save it in such a way that it can be used to carry out some (limited) analytics. At this point, the thermometer has already been installed and the libraries have been installed (check Setting up the thermometer)
Part of the code I am showing here was taken from the Ardumotive - How to use the DHT22 I have already referenced.</description>

      <title>Accessing the Pi remotely</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ll start my trip in the development with my Pi by explaining what I did to access it remotely, which normally is pretty straightforwards. I will also add a section on some absolutely not-straightforwards things that happened randomly one day, then stopped.
For most of the setup, I had direct access to the Pi with keyboard and a screen (it was not headless). I also relied a lot on a bunch of guides and tutorials I found online, which I will try to link in the post.</description>
