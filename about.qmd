### About this website
Hi! I'm Riccardo, and you're on my personal website. I will be using it to share 
updates on what I am up to, as well as some blog posts on stuff I may find interesting. 

### About myself
I am a research engineer employed by [P16](https://p16.inria.fr), a project 
within Inria whose objective is developing promising scientific libraries in Python. 
I am one of the core devs of the [Skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/) library, 
and among other things I am working on implementing in the library some of the 
code I worked on during my postdoc. 

Said postdoc involved figuring out the "best practices" to integrate information 
coming from data lakes with tables of interest. I split my time between  between 
the [SODA Team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) at  
[Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay) and the R&D department 
of [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com).

Before that, I obtained a PhD in Computer Science from [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr), 
in Sophia Antipolis (near Nice in the south of France).
The subject of the PhD was automating methods to integrate data and impute missing values.
I published some of my findings at SIGMOD2020 and EDBT2024. 

All my publications are available [here](/publications).

On the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming, anime/manga, technology and history.

I have been living in France since 2016, but for various reasons I am still not as 
fluent in French as I would like.  

My personal CV is available [here](/pubs/CV_cappuzzo.pdf).
