### About this website
Hi! I'm Riccardo, and you're on my personal website. The main objective of this website is having a public page where I
can share my contributions and what I have been up to. I am not planning to update this website very often.

If you want to contact me directly, then write me at `firstname.lastname[at]proton.me`,
and please do write where you got that email from, because I am very paranoid about it. 

### About myself
As of now, I am a research engineer employed by [P16](https://p16.inria.fr), a 
project within Inria whose objective is developing promising scientific libraries 
in Python. I am currently working on [Skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/), 
trying to implemenent in the library some of what I learned during my postdoc. 

Speaking of the postdoc, the objective was figuring out the "best practices" on 
what to do to integrate information coming from data lakes on tables of interest. 
It was a whole thing, and everything turned out to be way harder than we had 
expected at the beginning. 
During the postdoc I split my time between  between the 
[SODA Team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) at 
[Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay) and the R&D 
department of [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com).

I obtained a PhD in Data Science from [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr), in 
Sophia Antipolis (near Nice in the south of France).
The subject of the PhD was automating methods to perform data integration and 
missing values imputation. I published some of my findings at SIGMOD2020 and 
EDBT2024. All my publications are available [here](/publications).

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, and a Master degree in 
Communications and Computer Networks Engineering from 
[Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it). 

During my master, I spent a year and a half in France to complete a double degree 
in Computer Security from EURECOM.

I spent a semester as an intern at the SAP Labs in Mougins, where I worked on data anonymization for my master thesis, the results of which were presented as a 
Student Research Abstract at SIGAPP 2018.

On the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming, anime/manga, technology and history. 

I have been living in France since 2016, and I have been shamefully avoiding to 
write in French ever since.  

My personal CV is available [here](/pubs/CV_cappuzzo.pdf).
