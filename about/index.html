I’m Riccardo, and you’re on my personal website. The main objective of this website is having a public page where I can share my contributions and what I have been up to.

I will be working on Skrub, trying to implemenent in the library some of what I learned during my postdoc.\nSpeaking of the postdoc, the objective of the postdoc was figuring out the “best practices” on what to do to integrate information coming from data lakes on tables of interest. It was a whole thing, and everything turned out to be harder than we had expected at the beginning. I split my time between between the SODA Team at Inria Saclay and the R\u0026D department of Dataiku.\nI obtained a PhD in Data Science from EURECOM, in Sophia Antipolis (near Nice in the south of France).

All my publications are available here.\nI got my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering, and a Master degree in Communications and Computer Networks Engineering from Politecnico di Torino.\nDuring my master, I spent a year and a half in France to complete a double degree in Computer Security from EURECOM.\nI spent a semester as an intern at the SAP Labs in Mougins, where I worked on data anonymization for my master thesis, the results of which were presented as a Student Research Abstract at SIGAPP 2018.\nOn the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming, anime/manga, technology and history.
