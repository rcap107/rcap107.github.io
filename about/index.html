My name is Riccardo Cappuzzo, and I’m the author of this blog. I’m Italian, but I have been living in France for a few years now (unfortunately, I have yet to properly learn the language).\nI hold a PhD in Computer Science, which I’ve obtained from Sorbonne University after working for three and a half years at EURECOM, in Sophia Antipolis.\nI am currently working as Postdoctoral Researcher, researching methods for producing general use embedded representations of tabular data, and how to apply them to custom(er) data. I am part of the SODA Team at Inria Saclay, and a researcher for Dataiku at the same time.\nBefore moving to Paris, I’ve been living in the south of France for almost six years, starting as a student at EURECOM during my Master Degree.\nI got my Bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino in Turin, then I continued on with a Master degree in Communications and Computer Networks Engineering from the same University. At the same time, I did a year abroad to complete a double degree in Computer Security from EURECOM.\nAs a part of the double degree program, I worked as an intern in SAP Labs, working on a method for anonymizing data under the scope of the Toreador European project. The results that I’ve obtained during the internship were reported in my master thesis and in a student research abstract that I presented at SIGAPP in 2018. Finally, I spent five more months as a junior developer with the same team to wrap up what I had done over the internship and better integrate my code in the Toreador platform.\nIn October 2018 I went back to EURECOM, this time to work as a PhD student on the subject of automated models for data cleaning. During my PhD, I worked mostly on how to convert tabular data into embeddings, and on how to use said embeddings for “doing stuff”. I have published my work in SIGMOD and presented it in a number of different venues. All my publications are available in here.\nOn the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming (in some posts I might nerd out on some of my favorite titles), technology and history, as some of my previous colleagues might attest. I’m also trying to become a “maker” and build IoT devices to bore my dad with.\nIf you read this far, thanks, and I hope you’ll enjoy the blog!\n","wordCount":"411","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-04-08T16:45:31+02:00","dateModified":"2022-04-08T16:45:31+02:00","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Riccardo Cappuzzo"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://rcap107.github.io/about/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"A blog by RCAP","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://rcap107.github.io/logo.png"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://rcap107.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://rcap107.github.io/logo.png alt aria-label=logo height=30>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://rcap107.github.io/posts/about-me/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://rcap107.github.io/tags/ title=tags><span>tags</span></a></li><li><a href=https://rcap107.github.io/posts/ title=categories><span>categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://rcap107.github.io/publications/ title=publications><span>publications</span></a></li><li><a href=https://rcap107.github.io title=rcap107.github.io><span>rcap107.github.io</span>&nbsp;<svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12"><path d="M18 13v6a2 2 0 01-2 2H5a2 2 0 01-2-2V8a2 2 0 012-2h6"/><path d="M15 3h6v6"/><path d="M10 14 21 3"/></svg></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class=post-title>Something about myself</h1></header><div class=post-content><p>Hi!
