      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, hasn&amp;rsquo;t it? According the newly added archives page, the latest post in this blog goes back all the way to July 2012&amp;hellip; This is quite the embarassing showing given that I was hoping to release a post every week. Truth be told, up until (relatively) recently I did not quite have a lot I was interested in discussing.
However, something quite major happened a few months ago (last October, in fact), which has changed my living arrangements quite a bit.</description>

      <description>Notes on plots and dataframes Before we begin, a couple of notes on plots dataframes: this post has been prepared by converting a jupyter notebook into a markdown file using nbconvert. As it turns out, the default output format used by nbconvert to display dataframes isn&amp;rsquo;t rendered correctly by the Hugo backend I&amp;rsquo;m using for the blog. I was not able to find a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; solution for it, so for this post (and until I&amp;rsquo;ll find the actual fix) all tables are represented in raw html, rather than in a more decent format.</description>
