      <title>Moving up... or sideways?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;So, my postdoc is about to end (just a few more weeks left), and it seems like my next position has been decided! I will be a research engineer at P16, a development unit within Inria where I will be working on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://skrub-data.org/stable/&#34;&gt;Skrub&lt;/a&gt; Python library.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a short term contract (one year), which means that in a few months I&amp;rsquo;ll have to go back to looking for a new job. For the time being, however, I&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy spending more time at Inria.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New story on Medium: Retrieve, Merge, Predict</title>
      <link>https://www.riccardocappuzzo.com/posts/news/medium-post/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote a blog post on Medium! It summarizes most of the work we did in a more
digestible format than an academic paper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The post is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://medium.com/data-from-the-trenches/retrieval-augmented-ml-how-can-you-best-leverage-a-data-lake-d21c9f731cde&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>New submission: Retrieve, Merge Predict at VLDB2024</title>
      <link>https://www.riccardocappuzzo.com/posts/news/vldb_2024/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We submitted a revised version of our benchmarking paper to VLDB 2024, with the title &amp;ldquo;Retrieve, Merge, Predict: Augmenting Tables with Data Lakes&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preprint can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06282&#34;&gt;on Arxiv&lt;/a&gt;, while the code has its own &lt;a href=&#34;https://rcap107.github.io/retrieve-merge-predict/&#34;&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;, and is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rcap107/retrieve-merge-predict&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also release &lt;a href=&#34;https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10600047&#34;&gt;YADL&lt;/a&gt;, the semi-synthetic benchmarking data lake that we used to run our experiments. The repository is also available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rcap107/YADL&#34;&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;UPDATE June 2024: the paper was rejected. It was extremely disappointing, and I will write a post to detail what happened. It goes without saying that I am not happy about this outcome.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s been a while, hasn&amp;rsquo;t it? According the newly added &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.riccardocappuzzo.com/posts/archives&#34;&gt;archives&lt;/a&gt; page, the latest post in this blog
goes back all the way to July 2022&amp;hellip; Well, it does not seem like I kept my promise of posting with some frequency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No matter! Something did happen a few months ago (last October), and I have been quite busy because of it.
I have moved to Paris! For the next two years (starting last October), I have been/will be
working as a Postdoctoral Researcher for Inria Saclay in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://team.inria.fr/soda/&#34;&gt;SODA Team&lt;/a&gt; and at
&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dataiku.com&#34;&gt;Dataiku&lt;/a&gt; in their research department.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Studying the temperature readings</title>
      <link>https://www.riccardocappuzzo.com/posts/raspberry/study-temperature/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;notes-on-plots-and-dataframes&#34;&gt;Notes on plots and dataframes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before we begin, a couple of notes on plots dataframes: this post has been prepared by converting a jupyter notebook into a markdown file using &lt;code&gt;nbconvert&lt;/code&gt;. As it turns out, the default output format used by &lt;code&gt;nbconvert&lt;/code&gt; to display dataframes isn&amp;rsquo;t rendered correctly by the Hugo backend I&amp;rsquo;m using for the blog. I was not able to find a &amp;ldquo;clean&amp;rdquo; solution for it, so for this post (and until I&amp;rsquo;ll find the actual fix) all tables are represented in raw html, rather than in a more decent format. I also need to figure out a better way of saving the plots, which allow to specify a &lt;code&gt;facecolor&lt;/code&gt;, so that figures have a white background both in light and dark mode. For the time being, it&amp;rsquo;s possible to switch to light mode to fix that particular problem.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
