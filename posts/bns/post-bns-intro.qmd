Videogames are my biggest passion, and trying to play well is something I do
whenever I enjoy a game. For me, 
[minmaxing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_video_game_terms#Min-Maxing) 
is part of the fun.

Not all games can be optimized in the same way. In a lot of cases, it's a
combination of multiple factors, from mechanics to theorycrafting. As you might 
imagine, this post will focus on the latter. 

## What is this about? 
The idea behind this post and the next posts in this series is trying to
optimize how I play a specific game, and describing how I did it. For this series
I will be talking about a MMORPG called [Blade & Soul NEO](https://www.bladeandsoul.com/). 
The original Blade and Soul is almost 10 years old, but a "Classic" version was
released a few weeks ago, and after clocking more than 4000 hours on the original
version, I decided to give the revamp a try. 

Overall, I have been enjoying my time, and as a result I started looking into
ways to improve my gameplay. In particular, I looked into how I could improve
how fast I can kill bosses in PvE (Player vs Environment). Unsurprisingly, 
part of the solution is just getting better equipment. However, this got me 
thinking: **how can I optimize the equipment I have to deal as much damage to 
bosses as I can?**

One thing led to another, and I ended up writing code that would generate all 
possible combinations of equipment sets to find the best. I had a lot of fun 
working on it, and I thought it might be interesting, so I decided to write
about it in these posts. 

So, maybe you're interested in the game itself, or in how I used Python, Google
Docs, and various AI tools to _maximize my deepz_. Or maybe you're just 
interested in the ramblings of a mad man that clearly has way too much time 
on his hands. In any case, please follow along and dive into the rabbit hole 
with me! 

## The basics: how does equipment affect a character? 
Like in many other games, character _attributes_ (or stats) in Blade and Soul are 
given by a combination of _base stats_ and _additional stats_. _Base stats_ depend
on the character's class, level and some other sources, and remain mostly 
constant over time. 
On the other hand, _additional stats_ are provided by a character's equipment, 
and can change very easily simply by swapping different equipment pieces. 

Attributes can be either _offensive_, or _defensive_: the first category includes 
_Attack Power_ (AP), _Accuracy_, _Critical Rate_, and _Critical Damage_; 
the second _HP_, _Defense_, _Evasion_, and some more. I will focus mostly on the 
offensive stats, as defensive stats are not as interesting to optimize, and are
often treated as "dump stats".

Equipment in BnS can be divided broadly in **weapon and accessories**, 
**soulshields** and **badges**. All items can have one or more attributes, whose 
value will be added directly to the _base stats_ of the character. 

![A screenshot showing an earring and its stats.](/images/bns/bns_earring.jpg)

This earring, for example, has 40 _Accuracy_ and 76 _Critical Rate_ (let's ignore 
all the other stats for now). By equipping it, the _Accuracy_ and _Critical Rate_
of my character will increase by 40 and 76 respectively. 

**Soulshields** provide additional attributes, which are added to the base stats
like other equipment. For example, this soulshield gives HP (increasing how much 
damage my character can take), as well as _Critical Damage_ and _Defense_.

Each piece of equipment (or soulshield slice) is generated with a random set of 
statistics, and a random amount for each statistic. As a result, a player may 
collect a large number of copies of the same piece, and need to choose
which one to use. This is particularly important for soulshields, because it is
very easy to obtain their copies:

Given this context, the problem I am try to solve is the following:

::: {.callout-important}
I have many copies of each accessory, and a huge number of possible combinations
of accessories. How can I find the best set of equipment to use to maximize the 
damage my character deals to bosses? 
:::

To start working towards a solution, I first need to define how damage is dealt, 
and how to integrate that in my problem formulation, so that's what the next
section is for. 

## Damage in Blade and Soul: why and how 
In PvE, the objective is dealing damage to enemy bosses to reduce their HP to 0 
before they do the same to the player. In fact, the main gameplay loop involves 
killing bosses, getting their loot, improving equipment with the loot, then 
challenging stronger bosses for even better loot. 

Typically, boss fights require players hit the bosses as hard as possible, 
while executing a set of _mechanics_ (avoiding the boss' attacks, activating 
items in the arena etc.). If a player is executing everything correctly, then 
better attributes lead to better damage. In general, having more damage makes 
fights easier. Furthermore, some bosses have an _enrage timer_ that will 
immediately kill the player if they cannot eliminate the boss in time. 

I have been talking about damage to bosses all this time, and it's now time to 
define how damage is calculated.  For this, I will be using a damage formula 
that was [shared in the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/bladeandsoul/comments/hgi7by/damage_multiplier_calculator_spreadsheet/), 
and that goes as follows:
$$
Damage = AP \times (Crit\% \times CDmg + (1-Crit\%))
$$

The _Attack Power_ (AP) is the main offensive stat, as all damage is multiplied 
by this value; additionally, skills multiply this value by some modifier that 
depends on which skill is being used. 
$Crit\%$ is the probability to land a "Critical hit": a Critical hit deals 
additional damage equal to $AP\times CDmg$. Since not all hits are 
critical hits, the "Damage" is given by the damage of critical hits weighted
by how frequently they occur, in addition to the damage of hits that do not crit. 

As an example, let's consider $AP=500$, $Crit\%=55\%$, $CDmg=150\%$: the equation
would become 
$$
Damage = 500 \times (0.55 \times 1.5 + (1 - 0.55)) = 687.5
$$

In a vacuum, a character with 687.5 AP and 0 $Crit\%$ would deal the same damage
as a character 500 AP, 55% of crit chance, and 150% of bonus damage for crits. 
For simplicity, I am ignoring all sorts of class interactions with crits, and 
just taking the raw numbers. 

Clearly, better Crit% and CDmg would result in a larger value for Damage, and 
therefore better DPS: in practice, those are the main stats that player try to 
maximize. 

However, what we see on a character's profile is a raw number for _AP_, _Critical_ 
_rate_ and _Critical damage_. How can we turn those into the multipliers used above? 
Well, while there are no official numbers for this, the community managed to 
get an estimate of the formula ([source](https://bossrespawn.com/calculator)), 
which is what I am using here:
$$
Crit\% = \frac{Crit \times 96.98979}{Crit + 1124.069}
$$
where $Crit$ is the _Critical rate_ attribute.
$$
CDmg = \frac{CD \times 290.8}{CD \times 2102.36} + 125
$$
where $CD$ is the _Critical damage_ attribute. 

Usually, players strive to maximize _Attack Power_, _Critical rate_ and 
_Critical damage_. The problem then becomes understanding how these statistics
affect the final damage output, and selecting the equipment that leads to the 
best returns. 

In conclusion, now I have a (rough) estimation of how much damage my character
deals given a certain amount of AP, Critical rate, and Critical damage. While it
is not perfect, it's still a good starting point to optimize for. 

## To summarize, and what's next
This was a lot! Let's wrap up: 

1. I am trying to optimize the equipment of my character in the game Blade and Soul.
2. My objective is maximizing the amount of damage I deal to enemy bosses. 
3. I need a metric that lets me whether a set of equipment is good or not. 
4. I can use datamined formulas to estimate my damage, and use that as as 
my "objective function".

Now that I have a formula, I have a better idea of how to rank sets of equipments, 
and now I need to figure out how to generate all the combinations. This and some
more subjects I'd like to cover include:

- Drawing figures that use the damage formulas to draw some preliminary conclusions
from. 
- Writing some software that can select the best set of soulshields given a list 
of pieces.
- Figuring out a reliable way of getting the soulshield statistics. 
- Re-implementing the code I wrote in Python using a different programming 
language to exercise. 

If you got this far, I hope you found the post interesting, and thanks a lot
for reading!
