2025 has come to an end, and it was even more eventful than 2024. I thought I'd do another "year in review" like I did in 2024, but since it ended up much longer than I expected, I decided to split it into two posts. This post serves as a "shorter" summary, with a longer retrospective to follow.

## Highlights of 2025

- The Retrieve, Merge, Predict paper was finally published on TMLR in April. What a momentous occasion.
- skrub's monthly downloads hit about 120k by the end of the year.
- I presented the library at both PyData Paris ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9MNMDpgdAk)) and EuroScipy in Cracow ([video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbmfiBX5zZc)).
- I hosted a bunch of skrub sprints.
- I prepared the material for teaching skrub as part of the Inria Academy program, so that in 2026 I should be able to teach it.
- I obtained a certification as a "Scikit-learn professional practitioner."

## 2024 to 2025
First off, let's revisit what I talked about last year.

> Seriously though, every time I try to write something here I spend more time debugging Hugo than I do writing.

As it turns out, I ditched Hugo completely and switched to using Quarto to render the website instead. This turned out to be an excellent decision, as I can now use `quarto publish` to ensure the page renders correctly. Much saner syntax as well.

> Overall, most of the year was devoted to "the paper," that one article I have been working on for the past two years.

Part of the year was _still_ devoted to the paper, but this time it was accepted, so that chapter is finally closed.

> I should start looking for a new position soon enough, but first I'd like to get the paper done with.

In the end, I decided to stay and keep working on skrub until at least 2027. I found the experience to be far more rewarding than my time in academia. It has also been extremely instructive, as I learned so much about programming, hosting events, tooling up, and other skills that I am sure will be useful in the future. I also really like the people I work with, which is another huge plus.

> I would say that the year has been _very_ stressful, with burnout waiting for me after pretty much every paper deadline, and some extremely disappointing experiences in academia.

The year was far less stressful, although I did experience some burnout towards the end.

> If I have to come up with a theme for 2025, I think it will be something along the lines of "read more sources."

Nothing of the sort happened. Almost all the sources I stored went forgotten, and my switch from academia to development was almost entirely complete the moment I stopped reading papers.

It's interesting how I forgot almost everything that I wrote a year ago. I wonder what will happen next year, then.

## 2025 to 2026
My theme for next year: **writing and language**. This means dedicating more effort to learning French and maintaining a daily diary. It was a useful habit I picked up but then gave up on completely halfway through the year. I hope to be more consistent in 2026.

I'll also add "reading more books" to the list, which is something I used to do but haven't done enough of lately.

## Concluding: 2025 in short
Overall, I think 2025 went far better than 2024. My current position feels more rewarding, and I am very grateful to my superiors for shielding me from most of the office politics that occur above my level, though that may change in the future. We will see.

I learned so much through the year, from programming to using tools that make writing programs easier and faster. I got to travel to Poland for EuroScipy, which was a fun adventure, and presented skrub at PyData Paris.

I went from having three colleagues working on skrub, to being alone, to maybe having three colleagues again. What a rollercoaster.

I started a French course to improve my current knowledge of the language, though my relationship with it is still contentious.

Lots of changes, lots of lessons, some nice achievements—overall, a positive balance for 2025. Here's to an even better 2026!

Happy New Year, and see you in twelve months for the 2026 retrospective. Or, in the [next post](timeline-2025.qmd), where I'll go through 2025 month by month.
