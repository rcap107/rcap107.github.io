I wrote a new blog post on the Skrub materials website! 

This one is about finding out how to best encode categorical features using the 
categorical encoders provided by skrub. 


You can find the post [here](https://skrub-data.org/skrub-materials/notebooks/categorical-encoders/categorical-encoders.html).
