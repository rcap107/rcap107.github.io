Almost exactly two years in the making, our paper "Retrieve, Merge, Predict - 
Augmenting tables with data lakes" has _finally_ been published in 
[TMLR](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/index.html): you may find it 
[here](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=4uPJN6yfY1).

I am planning to write a proper blog post to summarize the results, as well as a 
[retrospective](retrieve-merge-predict-retrospective.md)
on the paper, just to reminisce on the effort it took to finally publish it.
