We submitted a revised version of our benchmarking paper to VLDB 2024, with the title "Retrieve, Merge, Predict: Augmenting Tables with Data Lakes". 

The preprint can be found [on Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06282), while the code has its own [website](https://soda-inria.github.io/retrieve-merge-predict/), and is available on [Github](https://github.com/rcap107/retrieve-merge-predict).

We also release [YADL](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.10600047), the semi-synthetic benchmarking data lake that we used to run our experiments. The repository is also available on [Github](https://github.com/rcap107/YADL).

UPDATE June 2024: the paper was rejected. It was extremely disappointing, and I will write a post to detail what happened. It goes without saying that I am not happy about this outcome.
