Today we had the SODA Kickoff, an event organized by some of the PIs (I still 
don't know what "PI" stands for, other than that it's not "private investigator") 
of the Inria team I am part of. 

It was very interesting! I got to hear about what all the other post docs, PhD
students, and researcher are working on, and I got to know some people I don't 
often talk with.

As part of the event, I presented [skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/) 
(not too unexpected), and had to prepare
a new slide deck to showcase the latest updates to the library. It was very well
received, and a lot of people complimented me for the presentation, which is 
always great :D

it is, together with the rest of the materials on our teaching website.
