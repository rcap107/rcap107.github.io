### About this website
Hi! I'm Riccardo, and you're on my personal website. The main objective of this website is having a public page where I
can share my contributions and what I have been up to. I am not planning to update this website very often.

### About myself
As of now, I am a research engineer employed by [P16](https://p16.inria.fr), a project within Inria whose objective is developing promising scientific libraries in Python. I will be working on [Skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/), trying to implemenent in the library some of what I learned during my postdoc. 

Speaking of the postdoc, the objective was figuring out the "best practices" on what to do to integrate information coming from data lakes on tables of interest. It was a whole thing, and everything turned
out to be harder than we had expected at the beginning. 
I split my time between  between the [SODA Team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) at 
[Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay) and the R&D department of [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com).

I obtained a PhD in Data Science from [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr), in Sophia Antipolis (near Nice in the south of France).
The subject of the PhD was automating methods to perform data integration and missing values imputation. I published some of my 
findings at SIGMOD2020 and EDBT2024. All my publications are available [here](/publications).

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, and a 
Master degree in Communications and Computer Networks Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it). 

During my master, I spent a year and a half in France to complete a double degree in Computer Security from EURECOM.

I spent a semester as an intern at the SAP Labs in Mougins, where I worked on data anonymization for my master thesis, 
the results of which were presented as a Student Research Abstract at SIGAPP 2018.

On the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming, anime/manga, technology and history. I'm also looking into IoT devices to have a "smart home" with OSS. 

I have been living in France since 2016, but please don't write to me in French because I _will_ reply in English.  

My personal CV is available [here](/pubs/CV_cappuzzo.pdf).
