summary: "What this site is about."

# What is this even about?
The idea behind the blog is having a single place where I can put posts on stuff
that interests me, or things I have learned over time, or weird side projects I 
embark in for various reasons. I am also doing this as a writing exercise, and 
mostly for fun. I am not planning to turn this website into something I dedicate
a lot of effort to. 

Some of the subjects I might cover include: 
* Complications encountered at work, developing, doing research, or anything else.
* Interesting experimental results.
* Posts about small programming stuff I do in my free time. 
* Updates on my publications.
* Miscellaneous nagging.

# How often are you going to update the blog?
I have no idea at the moment. It'll depend on how often I find something I'd like
to write a post about. Depending on how it goes, this may take months, weeks, days, 
or just never happen again.
