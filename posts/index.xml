      <description>&lt;p&gt;Disclaimer: this post will mostly be a rant. The reasons for it should become
sufficiently clear as I go over my experience in the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For context, I have been working on a paper for the past year or so. Said paper
involved running a few thousands experimental configurations over different
baselines, then reporting said experiments in a paper that was initially &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.riccardocappuzzo.com/posts/news/vldb_2024/&#34;&gt;submitted
to VLDB2024&lt;/a&gt; (end of
January this year). Said paper was rejected at VLDB 2024, submitted to SIGMOD2025,
and was rejected again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
