I will still try to get it to work, and report it here.\nFor the Uno, I got an adapter for MicroSD cards, so that it would be possible to use the microcontroller to log sensor data. I also need to get a fairly small MicroSD card because the Uno cannot handle more than 5-ish GBs of storage.\nIn my plans, I wanted to access the Pi remotely via wifi using SSH, which is problematic as the model I am working with does not have an integrated Wifi antenna.
