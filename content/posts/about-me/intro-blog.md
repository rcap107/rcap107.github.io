# What should you expect from this blog?
I am writing this blog to put together
some of the issues, solutions and discoveries I stumbled upon during my research.

Since it appears that I have a knack for finding weird and hard to reproduce
errors in the code I have to use (both mine and from other sources), you might
find posts on:
* Complications encountered during the installation of a new repository.
* Complications encountered while running a new repository.
* Interesting experimental results.
* Summaries and demonstrations prepared using my code.
* Updates on my publications.
* Miscellaneous nagging little issues.

# How often are updates going to be?
I have no idea at the moment. I will probably write up a few posts before
advertising this post *anywhere*, so there should be at least some content to
read by the time you might find this. Other than that, it'll depend on how often
I'll find new and interesting problems that waste my time, and on me actually
writing down the solution in a readable way.

# Are you ever going to update your github profile?
Hopefully this blog will be a compelling enough reason for me to get to do that
in the future. No guarantees yet, though.
