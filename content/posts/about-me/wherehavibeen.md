It's been a while, hasn't it? According the newly added [archives](/posts/archives) page, the latest post in this blog
goes back all the way to July 2012... This is quite the embarassing showing given that I was hoping to release a post 
every week. Truth be told, up until (relatively) recently I did not quite have a lot I was interested in discussing. 

However, something quite major happened a few months ago (last October, in fact), which has changed my living 
arrangements quite a bit. If you have (for some bizarre reason) been following my Linkedin profile, you might have 
noticed that I have moved to Paris. Yes, Paris! For the next two years (starting last October), I have been/will be 
working as a Postdoctoral Researcher for Inria Saclay in the [SODA Team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) and at [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com) in their research department. 

This is pretty cool! I get to be a part of a strong research group which includes the guys that maintain 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and I have contributed with some minor additions to [dirtycat](https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat): this will definitely be a great
learning experience as collaborative programming is something I have little to no experience in. 

On the other side, I get to work in a pretty cool, young company where everyone looks bright and prepared. That side of
the experience will be useful to get an idea of how things work in an enterprise setting, and the kind of problems that
enterprise people actually face (a stark difference from my academic experience). And, we get free breakfast every day!

Thus, I am currently splitting the time between these two realities and acting as the connecting thread between the two.

"What is the subject of this research project?",  I (figuratively) hear you ask. Well, we're still trying to figure that part out. While we started by working on the creation of embedded representations for tabular data, now we are 
moving on to the subject of testing the performance of systems for performing join suggestion. This will be quite the
task, considering that I have very little experience in the matter. However, it will be another learning experience, 
both in the specific subject, and in how I approach this research. We will start from benchmarking a number of 
different methods, and just figuring that part out will be an adventure.

In fact, I'm planning to convert some of the notes that I have gathered over the past few months in posts to add here. 
Hopefully, I'll keep up a better pace than I did between July and now.

I think that's all for now. I'm sorry it took this long, but the past few months have been quite full as you might imagine.
Cheers!
