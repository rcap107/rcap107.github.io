``$ whoami``

Hi! My name is Riccardo Cappuzzo, and I'm the author of this blog. I hold a PhD
in Computer Science, which I've obtained from Sorbonne University after working
for three and a half years at EURECOM, in Sophia Antipolis.
I've been living in the south of France for almost six years now, starting as a
student at EURECOM during my Master Degree.

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Politecnico di Torino in
Turin, then I continued on with a Master degree in Communications and Computer
Networks Engineering from the same university. At the same time, I did a year
abroad to complete a double degree in Computer Security from EURECOM.

As a part of the double degree programme, I worked as an intern in SAP Labs,
working on a method for anonymizing data under the scope of the Toreador
european project. The results that I've obtained during the internship were
reported in my master thesis (in [posts/publications/]) and in a student research
abstract that I presented at SIGAPP in 2018.
Finally, I spent five more months as a junior developer with
the same team to wrap up what I had done over the internship and better integrate
my code in the Toreador platform.

In October 2018 I went back to EURECOM, this time to work as a PhD student on the
subject of automated models for data cleaning. During my PhD,  I worked mostly
on how to convert tabular data into embeddings, and on how to use said embeddings
for "doing stuff". I have published my work in SIGMOD and presented it in a
number of different venues.

On the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming (in some posts I might nerd out
  on some of my favorite titles), technology and history, as some of my
previous colleagues might attest.

If you read this far, thanks, and I hope you'll enjoy the blog!
