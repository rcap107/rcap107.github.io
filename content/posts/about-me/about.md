Hi! My name is Riccardo Cappuzzo, and I'm the author of this blog. I'm Italian, but I have been living in France for a few years now (unfortunately, I have yet to properly learn the language).

I hold a PhD in Computer Science, which I've obtained from Sorbonne University after working for three and a half years at [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr), in Sophia Antipolis.

I am currently working as Postdoctoral Researcher, researching methods for producing general use embedded representations of tabular data, and how to apply them to custom(er) data. I am part of the [SODA Team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) at [Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay), and a researcher for [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com) at the same time. 

Before moving to Paris, I've been living in the south of France for almost six years, starting as a student at EURECOM during my Master Degree. 

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it) in
Turin, then I continued on with a Master degree in Communications and Computer
Networks Engineering from the same University. At the same time, I did a year
abroad to complete a double degree in Computer Security from EURECOM.

As a part of the double degree program, I worked as an intern in SAP Labs,
working on a method for anonymizing data under the scope of the Toreador
European project. The results that I've obtained during the internship were
reported in my master thesis and in a student research
abstract that I presented at SIGAPP in 2018.
Finally, I spent five more months as a junior developer with
the same team to wrap up what I had done over the internship and better integrate
my code in the Toreador platform.

In October 2018 I went back to EURECOM, this time to work as a PhD student on the
subject of automated models for data cleaning. During my PhD,  I worked mostly
on how to convert tabular data into embeddings, and on how to use said embeddings
for "doing stuff". I have published my work in SIGMOD and presented it in a
number of different venues. All my publications are available in [here](/publications). 

On the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming (in some posts I might nerd out
  on some of my favorite titles), technology and history, as some of my
previous colleagues might attest. I'm also trying to become a "maker" and build 
IoT devices to bore my dad with. 

If you read this far, thanks, and I hope you'll enjoy the blog!
