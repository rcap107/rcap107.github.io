Hi! I'm Riccardo, and I'm the author of this blog. I'm Italian, but I have been living in France since 2016.

I obtained a PhD in Data Science from [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr), in Sophia Antipolis (near Nice in the south of France).

I am currently working as a postdoc, splitting my time between the [SODA Team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) at 
[Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay) and the R&D department of [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com).

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, and a 
Master degree in Communications and Computer Networks Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it). 

During my master, I spent a year and a half in France to complete a double degree in Computer Security from EURECOM.

I spent a semester as an intern at the SAP Labs in Mougins, where I worked on data anonymization for my master thesis, 
the results of which were presented as a Student Research Abstract at SIGAPP 2018.

For my PhD, I focused on automated models for data integration and imputation of missing values. I published some of my 
findings at SIGMOD2020 and EDBT2024. All my publications are available [here](/publications).

On the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming (in some posts I might nerd out on some of my favorite titles), 
technology and history. I'm also looking into IoT devices to have a "smart home" with OSS. 

If you read this far, thanks, and I hope you'll enjoy the blog!
