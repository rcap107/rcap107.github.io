### About this website
Hi! I'm Riccardo, and you're on my personal website. The main objective of this website is having a public page where I
can share my contributions and what I have been up to. I am not planning to update this website very often (though things
can always change!).

### About myself
My CV is available [here](/pubs/CV_cappuzzo.pdf).

I am wrapping up my work as a postdoc, splitting my time between the [SODA Team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) at 
[Inria Saclay](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-de-saclay) and the R&D department of [Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com).

I obtained a PhD in Data Science from [EURECOM](https://www.eurecom.fr), in Sophia Antipolis (near Nice in the south of France).
The subject of the PhD was automating methods to perform data integration and missing values imputation. I published some of my 
findings at SIGMOD2020 and EDBT2024. All my publications are available [here](/publications).

I got my Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering, and a 
Master degree in Communications and Computer Networks Engineering from [Politecnico di Torino](https://www.polito.it). 

During my master, I spent a year and a half in France to complete a double degree in Computer Security from EURECOM.

I spent a semester as an intern at the SAP Labs in Mougins, where I worked on data anonymization for my master thesis, 
the results of which were presented as a Student Research Abstract at SIGAPP 2018.

On the personal side, I am a big fan of gaming, anime/manga, technology and history. I'm also looking into IoT devices to have a "smart home" with OSS. 

I have been living in France since 2016, though my French still leaves to be desired.
