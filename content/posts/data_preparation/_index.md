Posts in this section will go over some of the work I do on a daily basis, specifically how I procure, prepare and 
present datasets in order to make them fruible and understandable by my colleagues. If you have ever read any paper
on the subject of data preparation, cleaning or curation, you might have seen statements along the lines of "data
scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning data". From my experience, that's a trite statement that is also 
perfectly accurate. 

I hope I can give a glimpse of how much of a pain this problem can be by going over some of the more glaring issues 
involved in these operations.
