So, my postdoc is about to end (just a few more weeks left), and it seems like my next position has been decided! I will be a research engineer at P16, a development unit within Inria where I will be working on the [Skrub](https://skrub-data.org/stable/) Python library. 

It's a short term contract (one year), which means that in a few months I'll have to go back to looking for a new job. For the time being, however, I'll enjoy spending more time at Inria.

I'll miss Dataiku though, it's a great company and I met some really nice people there, despite the fact I was there only for one or two days a week.
