It's been a while, hasn't it? According the newly added [archives](/posts/archives) page, the latest post in this blog
goes back all the way to July 2022... Well, it does not seem like I kept my (very tentative) promise of posting frequently. 

No matter! Something did happen a few months ago (last October), and I have been quite busy because of it. 
I have moved to Paris! For the next two years (starting last October), I have been/will be 
working as a Postdoctoral Researcher for Inria Saclay in the [SODA Team](https://team.inria.fr/soda/) and at 
[Dataiku](https://www.dataiku.com) in their research department. 

This is pretty cool! I get to be a part of a strong research group which includes the guys that maintain 
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and I have contributed with some minor additions to [dirtycat](https://github.com/dirty-cat/dirty_cat): this will definitely be a great
learning experience as collaborative programming is something I have very little experience with. 

On the other side, I get to work in a pretty cool company where everyone looks bright and prepared. That side of
the experience will be useful to get an idea of how things work in an enterprise setting, and the kind of problems that
enterprise people actually face. And, we get free breakfast every day!

Thus, I am currently splitting the time between these two realities and acting as the connecting thread between the two.

So, what is the subject of this research project?
Well, we're still trying to figure that part out. While we started by working on the creation of embeddings of tabular data, 
now we are moving on to the subject of testing the performance of systems for performing join suggestion. This will be 
quite the task, given my scarce experience on the subject. We will start from benchmarking a number of 
different methods, and just figuring that part out will be an adventure.

I think that's all for now.

Cheers!
