Back during my University years I became interested in the development of IoT
devices and worked on a couple of projects in that vein. In the same period, I 
purchased both a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino Uno boards. While I did use the 
first on and off as a Linux box and tried to set up a media server with it,
the latter sat almost untouched for many years. 

In the lull I've experienced after finishing my PhD, I suddenly got interested 
in the topic again, and decided to buy a few sensors to build something more 
complex than a series of LEDs that turn on every other second.

In this series of posts, I will report the various challenges, issues (because, 
of course, there were plenty of both) and results of my experience with 
prototyping boards.
