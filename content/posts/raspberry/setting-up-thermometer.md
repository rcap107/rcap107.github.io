In this post I will be explaining how I prepared the Raspberry Pi so that it
could be used to read data from a DHT22 temperature/humidity sensor. To be 
clear, I did not exactly do much besides following a few guides, but still. 

The main links I have used are the following: 
- [Ardumotive - How to use the DHT22](https://www.ardumotive.com/how-to-use-the-dht-22-en.html)
