Embedding models describe methods for transforming "regular data" into modified
representations that somehow "encode" some property of the data. These representations
are implemented as "vectors" and have a number of nice properties that can be
exploited for a number of applications.

I will explore these concepts in a series of posts here. As EmbDI is based on
embeddings, these series will be strongly connnected to each other.
