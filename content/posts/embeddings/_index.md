Embedding models describe methods for encoding "regular data" (more often than not, text data) into representations that somehow maintain some property of the data. These representations
are implemented as vectors, whose properties can be used for various applications.

Embeddings are a major part of my current research, so I will try to discuss some 
of the results of that (as well as some things I did during my PhD) in these posts.
